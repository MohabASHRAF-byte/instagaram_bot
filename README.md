# Instagram Bot

This is a Python-based bot for automating certain tasks on Instagram, such as liking and following users. It uses the Selenium library to simulate user interactions on the Instagram website.

## Installation

To use this bot, you need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

In addition, you need to install the following libraries:

- Selenium (`pip install selenium`)
- ChromeDriver (download the latest version from [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) and put the executable in your PATH)

My apologies for misunderstanding your request. Here's the original text with the comments, following, and downloading options presented as bullet points:

## Usage

To use the bot, simply run the `main.py` file in the terminal:

```
python main.py

You will be prompted to enter your Instagram username and password, and choose whether to login with Facebook or Instagram. Then, you need to enter the handle of the user whose photos you want to interact with, and choose from the available options:

- Likes:
  - Choose to like all photos
  - Choose to unlike all photos
  - Choose to keep all photos as they are

  - Choose to unfollow the user

Once you have entered all the options, the bot will start interacting with the user's photos according to your choices.
